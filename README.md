# Health-Risk-Prediction
ML-based health risk prediction using lifestyle data
## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict health risk levels based on a variety of lifestyle and physiological data, such as sleep time, BMI, alcohol intake, physical activity, and more. It is based on a dataset available from Kaggle.
## Problem Statement
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict an individual's health risk level using easily available lifestyle indicators. This helps in early intervention and preventive care.
## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and contains anonymized health and lifestyle data.
**Features include:**
- Sleep Time
- Physical Activity
- BMI
- Alcohol Intake
- Smoking Status
- Age, Gender, Race
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
## Model Building
The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers. The data was then split into training and testing sets.
Several machine learning models were explored:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and F1 score.
